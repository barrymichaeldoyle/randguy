This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## End-to-End tests (Playwright)

Playwright is configured to spin up the Next.js dev server automatically and run tests in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

### Install browsers

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps
```

### Run tests

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

Open the UI test runner:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:ui
```

Run in headed mode for debugging:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:headed
```

Generate tests by recording actions against the app:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:codegen
```

Playwright config lives in `playwright.config.ts` and tests are in `tests/e2e`.
