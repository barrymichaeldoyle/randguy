So you've decided to start investing? Awesome! Let me break down what you need to know as a South African investor.

## Why Invest?

Investing is one of the best ways to build wealth over time. With inflation constantly eroding the value of your money, keeping everything in a savings account means you're actually losing purchasing power.

### The Power of Compound Interest

> "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it." - Albert Einstein

When you invest, your money earns returns. Then those returns earn returns. Over time, this compounding effect can turn modest investments into substantial wealth.

## Investment Options in South Africa

### 1. Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs)

TFSAs are a no-brainer for most South Africans:

- **Contribution limit**: R36,000 per year (R500,000 lifetime)
- **Tax benefits**: No tax on dividends, interest, or capital gains
- **Flexibility**: Can be in cash, unit trusts, or ETFs

### 2. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

ETFs are my favorite investment vehicle for beginners:

- Low fees (typically 0.1% - 0.5% per year)
- Instant diversification
- Easy to buy and sell on the JSE
- Popular options: Satrix Top 40, CoreShares S&P 500

### 3. Unit Trusts

Unit trusts are actively managed funds:

- Professional fund management
- Higher fees than ETFs (1% - 2% per year)
- Can outperform the market (but most don't)

## Getting Started: Step by Step

1. **Pay off high-interest debt** (credit cards, store cards, car loans etc. - excluding home loans)
2. **Build an emergency fund** (3-6 months of expenses in a savings account)
3. **Open a TFSA** at a low-cost provider
4. **Start small** - even R500/month makes a difference
5. **Stay consistent** - set up a debit order or schedule monthly transfers

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Trying to time the market
- Panicking during market dips
- Paying too much in fees
- Not diversifying
- Ignoring your TFSA allowance

## My Recommendation for Beginners

If you're just starting out, here's what I'd suggest:

1. Open a TFSA with <a href={LINKS.easyEquities} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Easy Equities</a> (my most recommended platform)
2. Set up a monthly debit order
3. Invest in a low-cost, diversified ETF like the Satrix 40 or MSCI World
4. Don't look at it every day - stay the course!
