**TL;DR:** Max your TFSA first. When you can invest more than **R3,000/month**, add an **RA** for the tax deduction. Do both over time. Consistency beats optimization.

## TFSA vs RA at a glance

### Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)

- **Annual limit**: R36,000 (R3,000/month)
- **Lifetime limit**: R500,000 total contributions
- **Tax**: No tax on growth, dividends, or withdrawals
- **Access**: Withdraw anytime (but you lose that contribution room forever)
- **Upfront deduction**: None

### Retirement Annuity (RA)

- **Deduction limit**: Up to 27.5% of taxable income, capped at R350,000/year for the deduction
- **Lifetime limit**: None
- **Tax**: Contributions reduce taxable income now; withdrawals are taxed later
- **Access**: Generally locked until age 55 (with limited early access)

Together, they give you the best of both worlds: tax savings today (RA) and tax-free withdrawals tomorrow (TFSA).

## The simple plan

- **If you can invest ≤ R3,000/month**: Put it all in your **TFSA**.
- **If you can invest > R3,000/month**: **R3,000 to TFSA**, the **rest to RA**.
- After ~14 years, you'll hit the **R500,000 TFSA lifetime cap**. From then on, direct all retirement savings to your **RA**.

Why this works:

- TFSA gains and withdrawals are tax-free forever, simplifying retirement.
- RA contributions lower today's tax bill, which boosts how much you can invest.

## Example: R4,000/month over 20 years

Assumptions:

- 10% annual return
- 27% marginal tax rate
- RA contributions are tax-deductible; withdrawals later taxed at 27% (simplified)

Years 1-14 (max TFSA first):

- TFSA: Contribute R3,000/month until the R500,000 lifetime cap is reached (you'll reach it in year 14; the last year is ~R32,000 to hit the cap).
- RA: Contribute R1,000/month alongside TFSA.
- Approximate tax saved on RA in this phase: ~R45,360 (R270/month × 12 × 14).

Years 15-20 (TFSA capped, all to RA):

- TFSA: No new contributions (cap reached).
- RA: Contribute the full R4,000/month.
- Approximate tax saved on RA in this phase: ~R77,760 (R1,080/month × 12 × 6).

Very rough outcomes after 20 years:

- **TFSA value**: ~R1.74M (tax-free)
- **RA value**: ~R960K (before tax on withdrawal)
- **Total tax saved from RA contributions**: ~R123,120

Bottom line: RA's tax deduction is great, but **TFSA-first keeps retirement simpler** and preserves tax-free withdrawals. Once TFSA is maxed each year, channel the rest to RA.

## When to tilt toward RA sooner

- **Higher marginal tax rate**: The bigger your tax rate, the bigger the RA deduction now. Check your rate with the [Income Tax Calculator](/calculators/income-tax). If you're in a higher bracket, prioritise contributing more to retirement (after maxing TFSA) to maximise the deduction.
- **Closer to 55**: RA's tax sheltering can be more valuable as retirement nears.
- **Discipline**: If the lock-in helps you avoid withdrawals, RA can be an advantage.

## A phased approach (optional)

### Ages 25-35

- Prioritise maxing TFSA; add RA with any extra.
- Aim to hit the R500,000 TFSA lifetime cap early to maximise years of tax-free growth.

### Ages 35-50

- Continue TFSA (if not yet capped) and **increase RA** to maximise deductions, especially in higher brackets.

### Ages 50-55

- Focus on **RA** contributions. If TFSA isn't capped yet, finish it, then direct all to RA.

## Common scenarios

- **You can save R3,000/month**: Max TFSA. You'll reach the lifetime cap in ~14 years.
- **You can save R4,000/month**: Do **R3,000 TFSA + R1,000 RA**.
- **You can save R6,000+/month**: **R3,000 TFSA**, rest to **RA**. After TFSA cap, all to RA.
- **You're 45 and starting**: **R3,000 TFSA**, rest to **RA**. Lean into RA deductions in higher brackets.

## Action steps

1. Decide how much you can invest monthly.
2. **≤ R3,000**: Use **TFSA**. **> R3,000**: **R3,000 TFSA**, rest **RA**.
3. Track progress with the [TFSA Calculator](/calculators/tfsa).
4. Set up debit orders. Increase contributions as your income grows.
