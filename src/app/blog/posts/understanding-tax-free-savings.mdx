Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) are one of the best investment tools available to South Africans. If you're not using yours, you're leaving money on the table.

## What is a TFSA?

A TFSA is a special type of investment account where you pay **zero tax** on:

- Interest earned
- Dividends received
- Capital gains when you sell

That's right - zero tax, forever!

## The Rules

### Contribution Limits

South African Revenue Service (SARS) sets strict limits:

- **Annual limit**: R36,000 per tax year (start of March to end of February)
- **Lifetime limit**: R500,000 over your entire life
- **Penalties**: 40% tax on any excess contributions (ouch!)

### Example Scenario

Let's say you contribute R36,000 every year:

```
Year 1: R36,000
Year 2: R72,000
Year 3: R108,000
...
Year 13.9: R500,000 (lifetime limit reached)
```

After about 14 years, you'll hit the lifetime limit. But those investments will keep growing tax-free forever!

**Use the [TFSA Calculator](/calculators/tfsa) to calculate your exact timeline based on your current contributions and monthly savings plan.**

## Where Can You Open a TFSA?

Pretty much any South African investment platform offers TFSAs:

1. **<a href={LINKS.easyEquities} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Easy Equities</a>** - Great for ETFs, low minimum (my most recommended)
2. **Satrix** - Simple, low-cost
3. **Allan Gray** - Unit trust focused
4. **Sygnia** - Low fees, good selection
5. **Old Mutual, Sanlam, Discovery** - Traditional providers

## What Can You Invest In?

Your TFSA can hold different asset types:

### Cash TFSAs

- Money market funds
- Fixed deposits
- Low returns but safe

### Equity TFSAs

- ETFs (Satrix Top 40, S&P 500, etc.)
- Unit trusts
- Individual shares
- Higher returns over the long term

### Balanced TFSAs

- Mix of cash, bonds, and equities
- Moderate risk and return

## My Strategy

Here's what I do with my TFSA:

1. **Max it out every year** - R36,000 is only R3,000/month
2. **Invest in global ETFs** - I go 100% global (mainly US equity via S&P 500 or MSCI World)
   - **Why global?** My retirement annuity (RA) already gives me SA exposure (by regulation), so my TFSA provides offshore diversification
   - **Currency hedge** - If the Rand weakens, my global investments become more valuable in Rand terms
   - **Growth potential** - Access to global tech giants and developed market returns
3. **Never withdraw** - Let compound interest work its magic
4. **Stay consistent** - Invest every month, ignore the noise

## The Math: Why TFSAs Are Incredible

Let's compare a regular investment account versus a TFSA over 20 years:

**Assumptions:**

- R36,000 invested annually
- 10% annual return
- 27% tax on capital gains (regular account)

| Account Type | Final Value | Tax Paid |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------- |
| Regular      | ~R1.8M      | ~R300k   |
| TFSA         | ~R2.1M      | R0       |

**You save R300,000 in taxes!** ðŸŽ‰

## Common Questions

### Can I withdraw from my TFSA?

Yes, but **you really shouldn't** unless it's for retirement:

- You can withdraw anytime (unlike an RA which locks until 55)
- Withdrawals **DO NOT** restore your contribution room
- Once you contribute R500k total, you're done forever
- **Think of your TFSA as retirement savings** - the goal is to let it grow tax-free for decades

If you need money for emergencies, use your emergency fund instead. The TFSA's power comes from long-term compounding.

### What if I contribute too much?

SARS will hit you with a 40% penalty on the excess amount. Use your provider's tools to track contributions carefully.

### Can I have multiple TFSAs?

Yes, but your **total** contributions across all accounts must stay under the annual and lifetime limits.

Therefore, I recommend you only keep one for simplicity and invest into a well diversified ETF.

## Action Steps

If you don't have a TFSA yet:

1. **Pay off high-interest debt** (credit cards, store cards, car loans etc. - excluding home loans)
2. **Build an emergency fund** (3-6 months of expenses)
3. **Open a TFSA this week** with <a href={LINKS.easyEquities} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Easy Equities</a> - Seriously, go do it now.
4. **Set up a debit order** - R3,000/month gets you to R36k/year
5. **Choose low-cost ETFs** - Keep fees under 0.5% per year
6. **Forget about it** - Check back in 10 years and be amazed

---

**Pro tip**: If you're under 30, a TFSA should be your #1 investment priority (after getting out of debt - excluding a home loan - and building an emergency fund). The decades of tax-free compound growth will set you up for life.
