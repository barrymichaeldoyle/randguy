The Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) is a safety net that provides short-term financial relief to South African workers who become unemployed or cannot work. If you're employed in South Africa, you're likely contributing to UIF every month - here's everything you need to know about it.

> **Calculate your UIF deduction:** Use the [Income Tax Calculator](/calculators/income-tax) to see exactly how much UIF you're paying each month based on your salary.

## What is UIF?

UIF is a government-managed fund administered by the Department of Employment and Labour. It provides temporary financial assistance to:

- Workers who lose their jobs
- Workers who cannot work due to illness or maternity
- Dependents of deceased contributors

Think of it as an insurance policy that you and your employer pay into together, ensuring you have some income if you suddenly lose your job through no fault of your own.

## Who Contributes to UIF?

**You must contribute to UIF if you:**

✅ Work more than 24 hours per month for an employer  
✅ Are a South African citizen, permanent resident, or refugee  
✅ Earn a salary or wages

**You do NOT contribute to UIF if you:**

❌ Are a foreign national working on a temporary work permit  
❌ Work less than 24 hours per month  
❌ Are an independent contractor or self-employed  
❌ Are a public servant who started working after April 1, 2006 (you contribute to the Government Employees Pension Fund instead)  
❌ Work for a foreign government (like an embassy)

## UIF Contribution Rates and Cap

**How much do you pay?**

- **Employee contribution:** 1% of your gross salary
- **Employer contribution:** 1% of your gross salary
- **Total contribution:** 2% of your gross salary

**Monthly cap:**

```
Maximum monthly contribution: R177.12 per person
Contribution ceiling: R17,712 per month
```

This means:

- If you earn **R17,712 or more per month**, you pay the maximum R177.12
- If you earn **less than R17,712 per month**, you pay 1% of your gross salary

**Examples:**

| Monthly Salary | Employee UIF | Employer UIF | Total UIF |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------ | --------- |
| R5,000         | R50.00       | R50.00       | R100.00   |
| R10,000        | R100.00      | R100.00      | R200.00   |
| R15,000        | R150.00      | R150.00      | R300.00   |
| R17,712        | R177.12      | R177.12      | R354.24   |
| R25,000        | R177.12      | R177.12      | R354.24   |
| R50,000        | R177.12      | R177.12      | R354.24   |

Notice that once you earn R17,712 or more, your UIF contribution stays at the maximum of R177.12 per month, regardless of how much more you earn.

> **Check your payslip:** You should see "UIF" as a deduction on your monthly payslip. If you earn more than R17,712/month, verify it's capped at R177.12.

## When Can You Claim UIF?

You can claim UIF benefits in these situations:

### 1. **Unemployment Benefits**

You can claim if you lose your job due to:

- **Retrenchment** - Your position was made redundant
- **End of contract** - Your fixed-term contract expired
- **Dismissal** - You were fired (but NOT for misconduct)
- **Employer insolvency** - Your employer went bankrupt or closed down

**You CANNOT claim UIF if you:**

- Resigned voluntarily
- Were fired for misconduct (theft, gross negligence, etc.)
- Are still employed
- Refused suitable alternative employment

### 2. **Illness Benefits**

If you cannot work due to illness (and you've exhausted your sick leave), you can claim UIF illness benefits.

**Requirements:**

- Medical certificate from a registered doctor
- You must have been unable to work for more than 14 consecutive days
- Your employer confirms you have no remaining sick leave

### 3. **Maternity Benefits**

Pregnant employees can claim UIF maternity benefits:

- Available for up to **4 months** (121 days)
- Can be claimed **1 month before** your expected delivery date
- Must have worked for at least 13 weeks in the last 52 weeks before your maternity leave

### 4. **Adoption Benefits**

If you adopt a child under 2 years old, you can claim adoption benefits.

### 5. **Parental Benefits**

Introduced recently, parental benefits provide 10 consecutive days for parents who are commissioning parents in a surrogacy agreement or adoptive parents.

### 6. **Dependants' Benefits**

If a UIF contributor passes away, their dependents can claim a death benefit.

## How Much Can You Claim?

**Unemployment benefits:**

Your UIF payout is calculated based on your earnings in the months before you became unemployed:

- You can receive between **38% to 60%** of your previous salary
- Lower earners get a higher percentage (up to 60%)
- Higher earners get a lower percentage (around 38%)
- Payments are capped at the maximum insurable earnings

**Duration:**

- You receive **1 day of benefits for every 4 days worked** (in the 4 years before unemployment)
- Maximum claim period: **12 months** (238 days)
- Minimum claim period: You must have worked at least 13 weeks in the last 52 weeks before claiming

**Example:**

If you worked for 2 years (730 days) before losing your job:

```
730 days worked ÷ 4 = 182.5 days of UIF benefits
```

You'd receive approximately 6 months of UIF benefits.

**Illness and maternity benefits:**

Similar calculation, but paid for the duration of your illness (up to 238 days) or maternity leave (up to 121 days).

## How to Claim UIF

### Step 1: Register at Your Local Labour Centre

Visit your nearest Department of Labour office within 6 months of losing your job. Bring:

- Your **ID or passport**
- **Proof of termination** (retrenchment letter, dismissal letter, or contract ending)
- **Bank statement** (not older than 3 months)
- **Last 6 months' payslips** (if available)
- **Employer's details** (name, address, contact info)
- **UI-19 form** (completed by your employer - this confirms your employment and UIF contributions)

### Step 2: Complete the Forms

The labour centre will help you complete:

- **UI-2.1 form** - Your unemployment claim application
- **UI-2.8 form** - Declaration that you're available for work

### Step 3: Attend the Interview

You'll have a brief interview where a labour officer confirms your claim details.

### Step 4: Wait for Processing

- UIF aims to process claims within **6-8 weeks**
- You'll be notified by SMS when your claim is approved
- Payments are made monthly into your bank account

### Step 5: Sign Biweekly

While receiving benefits, you must physically sign at the labour centre every 2-4 weeks to confirm you're still unemployed and looking for work. Missing a signing date can stop your payments.

## Online UIF Services

You can also apply online through the **uFiling** system:

1. Visit [www.ufiling.co.za](https://www.ufiling.co.za)
2. Register if you don't have an account
3. Submit your UIF claim electronically
4. Upload required documents
5. Track your claim status online

> **uFiling is faster:** Online claims are typically processed quicker than in-person applications.

## Important Things to Know

### Your Rights as a UIF Contributor

✅ You're entitled to claim UIF if you've contributed and meet the requirements  
✅ Your employer MUST deduct and pay over your UIF contributions  
✅ You can check your UIF credits by visiting a labour centre or using uFiling  
✅ UIF cannot be transferred if you move to another job (it stays in the fund)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Waiting too long to claim** - You must claim within 6 months of unemployment  
❌ **Not keeping documents** - Keep payslips, contracts, and termination letters  
❌ **Resigning without another job** - Voluntary resignation disqualifies you from UIF  
❌ **Not signing regularly** - Missing your signing dates stops your payments

### What if My Employer Didn't Pay UIF?

Some employers illegally fail to deduct and pay over UIF contributions. If this happens:

1. You can still claim, but you'll need to prove employment
2. Report your employer to the Department of Labour
3. Bring any proof of employment (payslips, contracts, bank statements showing salary deposits)

The Department of Labour will investigate and may recover contributions from your employer.

## UIF Credits: Understanding Your Balance

Every month you work and contribute to UIF, you accumulate **credits**:

- **1 credit = 1 day worked** (with UIF contributions paid)
- Your credits determine how long you can claim benefits
- You need at least **13 weeks of credits** in the last 52 weeks to qualify
- Credits expire after 4 years if not used

**To check your credits:**

- Visit your nearest labour centre with your ID
- Use uFiling online
- Request a statement from the UIF Contact Centre

## Recent Changes to UIF

### COVID-19 TERS (Temporary Employer-Employee Relief Scheme)

During the pandemic, UIF introduced the TERS benefit to help workers who couldn't work due to lockdowns:

- Paid 38-60% of salary
- Employers claimed on behalf of employees
- This was a temporary benefit and has now ended

### Increased Digitalization

UIF has been modernizing:

- Online claims through uFiling
- SMS notifications for claim status
- Electronic document uploads
- Faster processing times

## Tips for Maximizing Your UIF Benefits

1. **Keep accurate records** - Store payslips, contracts, and employment documentation in a safe place

2. **Register immediately** - Don't delay registering your claim after losing your job

3. **Stay compliant** - Always sign on your designated days to keep payments flowing

4. **Use online services** - uFiling is faster and more convenient than in-person applications

5. **Understand your UI-19** - Request this from your employer as soon as your employment ends

6. **Report back to work** - Once you find employment, inform UIF immediately to stop your claim (continued claims while employed is fraud)
