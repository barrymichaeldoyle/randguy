You earn R30,000 a month. That's a solid salary, right? But how much of that actually ends up in your bank account?

If you've ever stared at your payslip wondering why your take-home pay is so much less than your gross salary, you're not alone. Let me break down exactly where your money goes - and how you can keep more of it.

## The Basic Breakdown: R30,000 Gross Salary

Let's start with the obvious deductions that hit your payslip every month.

### 1. PAYE (Pay-As-You-Earn Tax)

**The big one:** PAYE is your income tax, calculated based on SARS tax brackets.

For a R30,000 monthly salary (R360,000 per year), you'll pay approximately **R4,800 per month** in PAYE.

**How is this calculated?**

- Your annual taxable income: R360,000
- After your annual tax rebate (about R19,800), you're taxed on progressive brackets
- The first R237,100 is taxed at lower rates, then it escalates
- Monthly: roughly **R4,800**

This is the single biggest deduction from your salary.

### 2. UIF (Unemployment Insurance Fund)

**The safety net:** UIF is deducted at 1% of your salary, but it's capped at **R177.12 per month**.

Since R30,000 is well above the R17,712 cap, you'll pay the maximum: **R177.12 per month**.

## What's Left After Basic Deductions?

Let's do the math:

```
Gross Salary:        R30,000.00
Less PAYE:           -R4,800.00
Less UIF:              -R177.12
───────────────────────────────
Take-Home Pay:       R25,022.88
```

So after the basic deductions, you're keeping roughly **R25,000** of your R30,000 salary.

That's about 83% of your gross salary - not bad, but we can do better.

## The Game Changer: Retirement Annuities

Here's where it gets interesting. If you contribute to a **Retirement Annuity (RA)**, you get a tax deduction. This means SARS taxes you on less income, effectively reducing your tax bill.

### How Retirement Annuities Reduce Your Tax

Contributions to an RA are tax-deductible up to:

- 27.5% of your taxable income, or
- R350,000 per year (whichever is lower)

For someone earning R360,000 per year:

- Maximum deductible: R99,000 per year (27.5% of R360,000)
- That's **R8,250 per month** maximum

### Example: Contributing R3,000 Per Month to an RA

Let's say you contribute R3,000 per month (R36,000 per year) to your retirement annuity:

**Without RA:**

- Taxable income: R360,000
- Annual tax: ~R57,600 (R4,800/month)

**With R36,000 RA contribution:**

- Taxable income: R324,000 (R360,000 - R36,000)
- Annual tax: ~R46,800 (R3,900/month)
- **Tax saved: R10,800 per year**

That's **R900 per month** saved on tax, just by contributing to your retirement!

**The real kicker?** You're saving R900/month in tax, while investing R3,000/month for your future. It's like getting a 30% bonus on your contribution.

### Your Final Take-Home with an RA

```
Gross Salary:              R30,000.00
Less PAYE (with RA):       -R3,900.00
Less UIF:                    -R177.12
Less RA Contribution:      -R3,000.00
─────────────────────────────────────
Take-Home Pay:             R21,922.88
```

Wait, that looks like less money in your pocket, right? But here's the thing:

**Without RA:**

- Take-home: R25,023
- Retirement savings: R0
- **Total: R25,023**

**With R3,000 RA:**

- Take-home: R21,923
- Retirement savings: R3,000
- Tax saved: R900
- **Total benefit: R25,823**

You're actually **R800 better off per month** while building your retirement savings!

## Why This Matters

That R3,000 per month contribution might seem like a big chunk, but:

1. **You save R900/month in tax** - effectively making your contribution R3,900 for the cost of R3,000
2. **You're building long-term wealth** - that R3,000 invested monthly will grow significantly over time
3. **You're reducing your tax burden** - less money to SARS, more money working for you

Over a year, contributing R3,000/month to an RA saves you **nearly R11,000 in tax**. That's real money that stays yours instead of going to SARS.

## Common Questions

### Can I Contribute More Than R3,000?

Absolutely! You can contribute up to R8,250 per month (for someone earning R360,000/year) and get the full tax deduction. The more you contribute, the more you save on tax.

### What About Other Deductions?

Your actual take-home might also be affected by:

- Medical aid contributions
- Group life insurance
- Pension fund contributions (if your employer has one)
- Other voluntary deductions

Each person's situation is different, which is why using the [Income Tax Calculator](/calculators/income-tax) is helpful to see your exact numbers.

### Should I Max Out My RA?

Not necessarily. Here's a balanced approach:

1. **Max your TFSA first** (R36,000/year = R3,000/month) - it's completely tax-free on withdrawals too
2. **Then contribute to your RA** for the tax benefits
3. **Balance both** based on your goals

## The Bottom Line

Your R30,000 salary doesn't mean R30,000 in your pocket. But understanding where your money goes - and using tax-advantaged accounts like retirement annuities - can help you keep significantly more.

**Key takeaways:**

- **Basic take-home (no RA):** ~R25,000/month (83%)
- **With R3,000 RA contribution:** ~R22,000/month take-home, but R3,000 in retirement savings + R900/month tax savings
- **Total benefit with RA:** R800/month more value compared to no savings

The numbers don't lie: contributing to your retirement isn't just good for your future - it's good for your current tax bill too.
